// Letâ€™s think of a ray as a function P(t) = A + tb.Here P is a 3D position along a line in 3D. A is the ray origin and b is the ray direction.The ray parameter t is a real number(double in the code).Plug in a different t and P(t) moves the point along the ray.Add in negative t values and you can go anywhere on the 3D line.For positive t, you get only the parts in front of A, and this is what is often called a half - line or ray.
